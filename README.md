üìà Stock Sage (A Stock and Crypto Forecasting App)

‚è≥ Project Overview:

The Stock & Crypto Forecasting App is a web-based application built using Streamlit, which allows users to forecast stock and cryptocurrency prices using advanced machine learning techniques. This tool incorporates machine learning models like Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTM for accurate predictions, alongside interactive visualizations powered by Plotly.

The app provides users with a seamless experience, including login authentication, asset selection (stocks and cryptos), and the ability to choose between various forecasting models. Additionally, the app includes features like a virtual portfolio simulator and real-time price tracking.

üîë Key Features:

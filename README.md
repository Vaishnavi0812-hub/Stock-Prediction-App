ðŸ“ˆ Stock Sage (A Stock and Crypto Forecasting App) 

Project Overview:

The Stock & Crypto Forecasting App is a web-based application built using Streamlit, which allows users to forecast stock and cryptocurrency prices using advanced machine learning techniques. This tool incorporates models like Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTM for accurate predictions, alongside interactive visualizations powered by Plotly.

The app provides users with a seamless experience, including login authentication, asset selection (stocks and cryptos), and the ability to choose between various forecasting models. Additionally, the app includes features like a virtual portfolio simulator and real-time price tracking.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication & Portfolio Simulation: Secure login and account creation, enabling users to save credentials and track portfolio performance.
2. Forecasting Models: Choose between Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTM models for stock and crypto predictions.
3. Real-Time Data & Customizable Timeframe: Fetch real-time stock/crypto data with the Yahoo Finance API and predict prices for different time frames (1-5 years).
4. Interactive Data Visualization: Interactive charts powered by Plotly for visualizing historical and forecasted data.
5. Multi-Asset Support: Forecast for a variety of assets, including major stocks (AAPL, GOOG) and cryptocurrencies (BTC-USD, ETH-USD).
